Project Name: Spell Checker Application in C++

Overview
This project is a basic implementation of a Spell Checker developed in C++ using Visual Studio. It allows users to validate and manage words across various categories such as foods, fruits, and professions. The Spell Checker leverages a simple interface for adding words and verifying their correctness while showcasing object-oriented programming concepts.

Features
- Word Validation: Check if a word belongs to predefined categories.
- Custom Categories: Includes words grouped into categories such as "foods," "fruits," and "professions."
- Interactive Input: Users can input words to validate against the Spell Checker.
- File Integration: Supports reading and writing data using file streams.

Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C++
- IDE: Visual Studio
- Libraries:
  - `<iostream>`: For standard input and output.
  - `<string>`: For handling strings.
  - `<fstream>`: For file handling.
  - Custom `Header.h`: Contains additional utility functions and class definitions.

How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spell-checker
   
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to compile the code.
4. Run the project to start the Spell Checker application.

Example Usage
- Insert predefined words:
  
  vector<string> wordsToInsert = {
      "Pizza", "Burger", "Apple", "Doctor"
  };
  
- Check a word:
  
  if (spellChecker.checkWord("Pizza")) {
      cout << "Word is valid!";
  } else {
      cout << "Word not found!";
  }
  

File Structure
- SpellChecker.cpp: Main implementation of the Spell Checker logic.
- Header.h: Contains class definitions and utility functions.
- main.cpp: Entry point for the application.

Future Enhancements
- Add more categories and words.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Support for dynamic word addition and removal.
- Integration with external dictionaries.
